    <p>Client is responsible for ensuring that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>(a) it has complied, and will continue to comply, with Applicable Data Protection Law in its use of the Services and its own Processing of Client Personal Data</li>
        <li>(b) it has, and will continue to have, the right to Transfer, or provide access to, Client Personal Data to Rainmaker Bots for Processing in accordance with the terms of the Agreement and this DPA.</li>

        <li>(b) as necessary to comply with applicable law</li>
        <li>(c) as otherwise agreed in writing by the parties ("Permitted Purposes")</li>

    <p>Taking into account the state of the art, the costs of implementation and the nature, scope, context, and purposes of Processing as well as the risk of varying likelihood and severity for the rights and freedoms of Natural Persons, Rainmaker Bots will implement appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure a level of security appropriate to the risk, as required by Art. 32 GDPR. This may include:</p>
    
    <ul>

    <p>Client provides a general consent for Rainmaker Bots to engage onward subprocessors, conditional on the following requirements:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any onward subprocessor must agree in writing to only Process data in a country that the European Commission has declared to have an "adequate" level of protection; or to only Process data on terms equivalent to the Standard Contractual Clauses, or pursuant to a Binding Corporate Rules approval granted by competent European data protection authorities</li>
        <li>Rainmaker Bots will restrict the onward subprocessor's access to Client Personal Data only to what is strictly necessary to provide the Services, and Rainmaker Bots will prohibit the subprocessor from Processing the Client Personal Data for any other purpose.</li>

    <p>In the event that any request, correspondence, enquiry or complaint from a data subject, regulatory or third party, including, but not limited to law enforcement, is made directly to Rainmaker Bots in connection with Rainmaker Bots's Processing of Client Personal Data, Rainmaker Bots will inform Client providing details of the same, to the extent legally permitted.
